For the time being, a special fork of the pymad package needs to be
installed in order to run the cowbell example.  It is included in the
cowbell example. In the future, the standard pymad package will be used.

Also an adapted version of py-lame can be used. It is provided as well
as python-lame.zip in the cowbell example.
