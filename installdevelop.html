        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <a href="index.html">Remix</a>, it turns out, is a surprisingly complex package:  it has C extensions, addtional binaries, and so on.
        This makes it a little inconvenient to install it for development with the typical python install tools.
        Specifically, if you want to use setup.py develop, or install it in a virtualenv, there are a few extra things you'll need to do.

        
        
        <h2>Using setup.py develop</h2>
        In a perfect world, you could do <code>python setup.py develop</code>, and everything would work.
        However, due to a known issue with setuptools ignoring the package_dir paths in setup.py, you'll need to tweak things a little.
        
        Specifically, setup.py will create a link file to connect your remix install folder to your python packages folder.  
        The link in this file is <em>wrong</em>.  It will look something like:
            
        You need to change it to ../remix/src/echonest.
        You need to do the same thing in easy-install.pth:  change _____ to ../remix/src/echonest

        Finally, you need to add a line to each of these files, for the pyechonest submodule:  remix/pyechonest
